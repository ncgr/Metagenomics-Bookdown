## Kraken/Centrifuge Family

Kraken 1 is obsolete

Centrifuge was written to improve Kraken's memory issues. It is completely new code with a different classification index. Its databases are also much smaller. We'll use centrifuge later in the course.

KrakenUniq is based on Kraken 1

Kraken 2 uses "probabilistic data structures" to reduce memory and increase speed at the expense of lower accuracy that leads to false positives during the classifications ("a few dozen out of millions").

KrakenUniq

In May 2022 (v0.7+), an update to KrakenUniq helped to deal with the large databases on computers without enough RAM to load them into memory. Databases can be read in chunks that fit in RAM.

## KrakenUniq databases


KrakenUniq requires Kraken1 not Kraken2 databases

We won't build a database since it can take several days, but let's look at the documentation:  
https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq#database-building

You can also get prebuilt databases:  
https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2

We will use a bacterial databases located here:  
/home/cjb/indexes/krakenuniq/db_052422


Link to it.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ln -s /home/cjb/indexes/krakenuniq/db_052422/ .
```

The taxa it contains are here:  
/home/cjb/indexes/krakenuniq/db_052422/library/bacteria/library_headers.orig

Take a look at the file.
How many sequences are there?

How many genera?
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
awk '{print $2}' /home/cjb/indexes/krakenuniq/db_052422/library/bacteria/library_headers.orig | sort -u| wc -l
```

And how many of each genera?
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
awk '{print $2}' /home/cjb/indexes/krakenuniq/db_052422/library/bacteria/library_headers.orig | sort | uniq -c | less
```

## Run KrakenUniq

Make a working directory and go into it.
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
mkdir ~/krakenuniq
cd ~/krakenuniqu

Activate the KrakenUniq environment.
```{bash, eval=TRUE}
source activate krakenuniq
```

Run Kraken on sample 3469-3.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
time krakenuniq \
	--db /home/cjb/indexes/krakenuniq/db_052422 \
	--threads 32 \
	--report-file report \
	--unclassified-out 3469-3.unclassified.fna \
	--classified-out 3469-3.classified.fna \
	~/microbe_fastq/3469-3.microbe.fq.gz \
	> 3469-3.krakenuniqoutput
```

Now run it on the other samples.
