# Nanopore Read QC

### Quality Control{-}

+ “PycoQC computes metrics and generates interactive QC plots for Oxford Nanopore technologies sequencing data” (https://a-slide.github.io/pycoQC/ )

![](Figures/Pyco2.png){width=25%}

1. What do we need in order to run a Quality Control Check?
+ Sequencing Summary File 
    + Automatically produced by the MinIon basecaller.
+ PycoQC package + dependencies 
    + Already downloaded for you in Ghostwheel.
+ Line of code to produce .html file.
+ Line of code to secure copy file to your computer.

## Sequencing Summary File
 
Where is it?

```
/home/data/metagenomics-2310/red-alder-reads/sequencing_summary_FAS21661_9ac87089.txt
```

## PycoQC package & code

1. Where is it? How to activate it?
+ Log in to Ghostwheel
+ Stay in your home directory (check with pwd)
+ Type the following: 
		
```
source activate pycoQC
pycoQC
pycoQC –f inputfilename.txt –o outputfilename.html
```

## Secure Copy 

1. What terminal to copy from? What is the code?

+ Open new Terminal window but don't connect to the linux server	
+ Type:

```
scp -P 2310 <username>@inbre.ncgr.org:/home/<username>/outputfile.html ~/Desktop/
```

### Normalization

With normalization we are trying to get the correct relative gene expression abundances between cells. 

Gene expression between cells is based on count data.

What does a count in a count matrix represent?

-	mRNA Capture
-	Reverse transcription of mRNA
-	sequencing of a molecule of mRNA

The most common normalization protocol is:

-	count depth scaling
-	aka CPM or counts per million
-	it assumes that all cells in the dataset initially contain an equal number of mRNA molecules
-	it assumes that count depth differences arise from sampling

Normalize complete 

-	But wait!
-	We still have unwanted variability in the data.
-	What kind of unwanted variability?
-	What is the solution? Data Correction. 

### Data correction and integration

Biological Covariates

-	Cell-Cycle effects
-	Batch
-	Dropout

Which Covariates to Consider?

-	Depends on downstream analysis
-	Correct for biological and technical to be considered separately
-	Corrections are used for different purposes
-	Each approach to correction presents unique challenges

What are the Correction methods?

-	Regressing out biological effects
-	Regressing out technical effects
-	Batch effects and data integration
-	Expression recovery
