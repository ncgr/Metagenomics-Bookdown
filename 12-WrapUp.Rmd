## Server access and acknowledgements

For those of you who requested continued access to our server, we will extend your account for 1 year. If you need it longer, please email us and we'll be happy to work with you. We ask that you don't run really large jobs while we are running workshops to avoid slowing things down. So, if you have a really large job to run, please check in with us so we can let you know when workshops will be happening.

Please note, if you use our servers to do analysis that you publish, you need to acknowledge the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) and the INBRE grant in your acknowledgements. Instructions for the latter can be found here: https://nminbre.nmsu.edu/cite-us/cite-us.html. This is really important for our annual reports so thank you in advance!
