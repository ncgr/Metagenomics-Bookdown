# Getting Started

## Installs

Make sure the following software is installed on your local computer before the workshop. Please contact Ethan Price at inbre\@ncgr.org if you have questions.

1. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)

Install the correct version for your OS. Don't plan to use the web version, as this does not have enough features. 

2. [Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)

3. [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) (Windows Users Only. Mac or Linux users will use their native terminal)

* Download the "Home" "Installer" edition.  Be careful not to install the portable or professional editions.  

* Before installing, extract the installer zip folder to any location on your computer.  

* Now run the installer and follow the prompts.

4. [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

5. [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (Latest Version for your OS)

6. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

7. [Pavian](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/pavian)

Follow the install instructions on [Pavian's GitHub](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/pavian).  This requires installs #6 and #7 to be complete
